        Rules of Uno:\n\n

        # of Players: 2-10\n\n

        Each player begins the match with 7 cards. 1 card is then removed from the deck and placed in the playing area. This is the start of the discard pile.\n\n"

        The current player (and the one which starts) will be highlighted in yellow. To play a card, one of their cards must match by either value, color, or action type. You may also play a wild or wild draw four card if you have none of the previously mentioned cards.\n\n

        The gameplay flow is denoted by the yellow arrow on the left in the playing area. The players total score is listed on the right.\n\n

        When a player reaches the point where they have only one card left, they should called "UNO!" to prevent themselves from getting called out. If another player calls their "UNO!" before they themselves do, then they must draw 2 cards from the draw pile. The game ends once a player gets rid of all of their cards in their hand.\n\n

        Action Cards:\n

        Reverse: Changes turn direction (denoted by the arrow)

        Skip: Skips the next players turn

        Draw Two: Makes the next player draw two cards and skips their turn

        Wild: Allows the current player to select any color they wish to play

        Wild Draw Four: Allows the current player to select any color they wish to play, while also making the next player draw four cards and skipping their turn. May only be used if no other cards in the players hand may be played.\n

        Scoring:\n

        After the game ends, the scores of each player are totaled together and are added to the winner's global score. The following is the breakdown of points for each card type:\n

        Numbered Cards: Points equivalent to their value

        Draw Two: 20 Points

        Reverse: 20 Points

        Skip: 20 Points

        Wild: 50 Points

        Wild Draw Four: 50 Points
